# 1U---15HP-Buffered-Multiple
A buffered multiple that fits in a 1U (Intellijel format) row.
This module contains a few SMD parts (resistors and IC's),
most parts are through-hole. 
It has reversed polarity protection and fuses. 
All parts can be bought at your preffered supplier, I mainly switch between Mouser, Tayda, Exploding Shed ,Banzai Electronics or Thonk
depending on what I need and what budget...
For this build you can buy all items in the BOM at Tayda, links are in the BOM included.
